## How do I get Jupyter to run on my Computer?
- Check to see if you have python loaded on your computer.  
- From a command prompt try to run the ```python``` or ```python3``` command
- Did you get a ```>>>``` prompt?
- You could also run ```python --version``` to see the version installed.
- If you don't have python, install it from https://www.python.org/ 
- Check for pip with the ```pip --version``` command
- run ```pip install jupyter```
- You may also want to add some common python libraries.
```
pip install pandas
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib
```

- Once installed, navigate your way to your jupyter folder and run the ```jupyter notebook --no-browser``` command.
